	<p>1. You can shapeshift at will with the <em>Transform</em> ability, but keep out of sight of the crew when you change forms! You won't be able to transform until a few minutes into the round after experiencing some werewolfy symptoms.</p> 

	<p>2. Your objectives will always be stored in your notes. To access them, use the <em>Notes</em> verb.</p>

	<p>3. <em>Beware!</em> Werewolves can't wear jumpsuits, exosuits or shoes. Furthermore, the wolf-like form is completely useless for stealth.</p>

	<p>4. Use the <em>DISARM</em> intent on somebody for a guaranteed (but brief) knockdown, or slash at them with the <em>HARM</em> intent to wear down their health and capacity to fight back.

	<p>5. Once you've incapacitated the victim, use the <em>Maul Victim</em> ability to feast on them. This will also heal a considerable amount of brute and burn damage in case you're injured.
	
	<p>6. Certain leftover organs can be <em>consumed</em> to restore a minor amount of health.

	<p>7. For more information, please consult <A HREF='http://wiki.ss13.co/Werewolf'>the wiki</A>.</p>
